		<h1>Mandelbrot Set Explorer</h1>

		<p>
			This is my app for browsing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGMRB4O922I">the Mandelbrot Set fractal</a> as if it were Google Maps.
		</p>

		<p>
			It works the same as regular Google Maps, but instead of downloading images of maps, your computer calculates the images using the normal Mandelbrot Set algorithm.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've written a couple of rendering engines for it so you have to pick one.
		</p>

		<div class="options">
			<a class="option" href="shader-leaflet">
				<span class="title">On your GPU</span>
				<p class="description">
					Render the fractal on your graphics card. This is insanely fast for even quite high numbers of iterations, but doesn't support double-precision numbers so you can't zoom as far in.
				</p>
			</a>

			<a class="option" href="leaflet">
				<span class="title">On your CPU</span>
				<p class="description">
					Render the fractal on your main CPU. This is much slower than rendering on a GPU, but supports double-precision numbers and so you can zoom in ridiculously far.
				</p>
			</a>
		</div>

		<p>
			There's also this <a href="original">legacy version</a> which runs on the CPU but isn't as good and is only here for historical interest.
